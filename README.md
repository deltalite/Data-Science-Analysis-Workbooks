# Data Science/Analysis Workbooks
Collection of my various data analysis/model preparation workbooks.

Most of these projects are associated with Kaggle. They have vast collections of data as well as competitions that I'll use to guide my learning for new Data Science techniques.

## Titanic
Kaggle's introductory competition for learning how to generate predictions based on both categorical and continuous data. 

## Digit_Recognizer
A Kaggle competition for learning about computer vision techniques using data from 28x28 images in order to predict digits written. The data is taken from the MNIST database and is a classic dataset for practicing ML/Deep Learning techniques.
