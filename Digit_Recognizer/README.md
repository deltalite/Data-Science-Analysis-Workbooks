# Digit_Recognizer

Process and solution for [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) Kaggle competition.

I used this Digit_Recognizer project to teach myself about CNN models and how to apply and improve them given the task of data recognition using MNIST data. In the process, I ran into some gaps in my knowledge involving:
* common varations on ANNs - CNNs, RNNs, how they are commonly implemented in Python and why/when to use them
* optimizers such as *adam* and *momentum*
* situational selection of batch size, number of epochs, convolution filters and much more
